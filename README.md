# About
Small POC created to teach myself 6502 assembly language.
This is not a completed game.

* 6502 basics learnt from https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/
* Nes Cpu memory map and programming guidances were learnt from nesdev.org
* https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NES_reference_guide
* https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/CPU_memory_map
  
## Build 
Need cc65 installed https://cc65.github.io.
Run:
```
./build.sh
```
This will produce brkout.nes 
I have tested both in emulator and in real hardware using a flash cart.
An already assembled  brkout.nes is uploaded so you can just run it on any nes emulator without installing all the environment.

Any question contact me: grafgonzalo@gmail.com
